### Industrial Anomaly Detection `by Mehmet Semih BABACAN`

Welcome to my Industrial Engineering project demo, focused on developing a deep learning-based system that can detect anomalies in industrial images. This demo showcases an anomaly detection method that I have implemented and trained on healthy samples only: **SPADE** method.

To use the demo, simply access the side panel on the left to configure a training run. Once the training is complete, you can browse through the predictions and see how the model performed on the test images. Additionally, you can upload your own training set and test images to test the models on your own data.

My ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly web application that can help industrial engineers detect and prevent anomalies before they cause any damage. Thank you for taking the time to explore my project demo.
